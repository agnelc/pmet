	<?php /* User-defined functions

		function name($argument1, $argument2 ...) {
		    statement
		}

		does NOT require semicolons except after statements
		{} go around function statements

		Functions can call any PHP code, even other functions

		Function name can contain letters, numbers, underscores, dashes (no spaces)
		but name must start with a letter or underscore
		Names are case-insenstive but it is better to call them exactly as they were defined

		In PHP3, functions must be defined prior to calling them
		In PHP4/5, can appear anywhere (base-level functions are pre-processed)

		Once defined, functions can be called from anywhere
		Once defined, functions can't be redefined

		Avoid declaring functions inside functions or conditionals while you are beginner.
		(It's no problem for you to CALL functions from inside funtions though!)
