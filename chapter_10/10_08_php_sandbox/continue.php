		Imagine that every loop has an implicit "continue" at the end

		You can also have an explicit "continue" which will loop back to the top immediately
			i.e. skip the remaining statements and start the next cycle of the loop
		Useful if you can quickly determine that the rest of the loop contents won't apply
		If you can, it could speed up your loop!
